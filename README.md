# PostProcessingGui
This Cura plugin simply adds a GUI to simplify adding layer-based post-processing scripts.

A new button will be appear when in the Preview tab of Cura with a sliced model that will allow a script to be added at the currently-selected layer number.  

Buttons will also appear for post-processing scripts that activate at specific layers in the model. 

Finally, when saving gcode to a file or sending it to a printer, the plugin will display a rough estimate of when each post-processing script's changes will take effect.  This can be useful, for instance, for determining when a print will pause.

And that's about it.  Not earth-shattering by any means, but it makes my life easier.
