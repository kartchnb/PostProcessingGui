# PostProcessingGui
This Cura plugin simply adds a GUI to simplify adding layer-based post-processing scripts.

A new button will be appear when in the Preview tab of Cura with a sliced model that will allow a script to be added at the currently-selected layer number.  

Buttons will also appear for post-processing scripts that activate at specific layers in the model. 

And that's about it.  Not earth-shattering by any means, but it makes my life easier.
